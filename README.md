# Fyber Offers

## Description

Tha main goal is create a simple web interface to interact with the [Fyber Offer
API](http://developer.fyber.com/content/ios/offer-wall/offer-api).


### Thoughts

- Create a simple Ruby interface to fetch Fyber Offers;
- Make sure that is everything tested;
- Using sinatra to create a form and view to process the response from the Fyber
API; (Rails it seems to be too much overkill to single form project)
